# InfluenceOps: Tactical Pretexting  
_A Hands-On Workshop in Social Engineering_

Pretexting is one of the most underestimated yet effective tools in modern adversarial tradecraft. In this interactive two-hour workshop, we explore how pretexts are constructed, delivered, and adapted in real-world engagements. Participants will learn how to transform raw OSINT into tailored psychological operations that influence targets across physical, digital, and voice-based attack surfaces.

## What You’ll Learn

- **Foundations of Pretexting**: Understand key psychological levers, historical examples, and ethical boundaries.
- **OSINT for Adversarial Simulation**: Learn how to gather actionable intelligence and map human attack surfaces.
- **Persona Development**: Build layered identities that withstand scrutiny and blend into target environments.
- **Scenario Crafting**: Structure narratives that align with organizational realities and adversarial objectives.
- **Tactical Execution**: Practice delivering pretexts via phishing, vishing, and in-person simulation.
- **Compliance & Ethics**: Operate within legal and contractual limits while still achieving engagement goals.
